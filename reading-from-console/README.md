# Reading from the console

Here we'll read things from the Standard Input and react from it.

## Activity Diagram

You know how to read it... but there's a new symbol: Diamond/rhombus

It means "Conditional", a question is asked in the diamond shape, and each answer (and in turn the
flow of the program) will continue separate ways.

It's possible the ways merge later, or maybe they never do. But when they merge, a small diamond
joins all previous "logic routes" into one.
