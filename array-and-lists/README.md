# Arrays and Lists

Very rough and quick sample of using an array (fixed say container of types) and
a List (a container capable of growing).

The program here loops over a fixed array, grows it one more item, uses a list
and feeds it from the original array and iterate both containers.

## Activity Diagram

You know how to read it... loops are expressed with the already known symbols
(ellipses, diamonds & rhombuses).
